                        <p class="item-text display-7">What is a vaginal yeast infection?
<br>A vaginal yeast infection, also known as candidiasis, is a common condition. A healthy vagina contains bacteria and some yeast cells. But when the balance of bacteria and yeast changes, the yeast cells can multiply. This causes intense itching, swelling, and irritation.
<br>Treating a vaginal yeast infection can relieve symptoms within a few days. In more severe cases, it may take up to 2 weeks.
<br>Vaginal yeast infections aren’t considered a sexually transmitted infection (STI), commonly known as sexually transmitted disease (STD). Sexual contact can spread it, but women who aren’t sexually active can also get them.
<br>Once you get a yeast infection, you’re also more likely to get another one.
<br>Yeast infection symptoms
<br>Vaginal yeast infections have a common set of symptoms, such as:
<br>•	vaginal itching
<br>•	swelling around the vagina
<br>•	burning during urination or sex
<br>•	pain during sex
<br>•	soreness
<br>•	redness
<br>•	rash
<br>Whitish-gray and clumpy vaginal discharge is another telltale symptom. Some people say this discharge looks like cottage cheese. Sometimes the discharge may also be watery.
<br>Usually the length of time your yeast infection is left untreated has a direct impact on how severe your symptoms may become.
<br>Yeast infection causes
<br>The fungus Candida is a naturally occurring microorganism in the vaginal area. Lactobacillus bacteria keeps its growth in check.

                        <h5 class="item-subtitle mbr-fonts-style pb-3 display-4"><strong>Prolapse</strong></h5>
                        <p class="item-text display-7">What is a prolapsed uterus?
<br>The uterus (womb) is a muscular structure that’s held in place by pelvic muscles and ligaments. If these muscles or ligaments stretch or become weak, they’re no longer able to support the uterus, causing prolapse.
<br>Uterine prolapse occurs when the uterus sags or slips from its normal position and into the vagina (birth canal).
<br>Uterine prolapse may be incomplete or complete. An incomplete prolapse occurs when the uterus is only partly sagging into the vagina. A complete prolapse occurs when the uterus falls so far down that some tissue protrudes outside of the vagina.
<br>What are the symptoms of uterine prolapse?
<br>Women who have a minor uterine prolapse may not have any symptoms. Moderate to severe prolapse may cause symptoms, such as:
<br>•	the feeling that you’re sitting on a ball
<br>•	vaginal bleeding
<br>•	increased discharge
<br>•	problems with sexual intercourse
<br>•	the uterus or cervix protruding out of the vagina
<br>•	a pulling or heavy feeling in the pelvis
<br>•	constipation or difficulty passing stool
<br>•	recurring bladder infections or difficulty emptying your bladder
<br>If you develop these symptoms, you should see your doctor and get treatment right away. Without proper attention, the condition can impair your bowel, bladder, and sexual function.&nbsp;<br></p>

                        <p class="item-text display-7">What are fibroids?
<br>Fibroids are abnormal growths that develop in or on a woman’s uterus. Sometimes these tumors become quite large and cause severe abdominal pain and heavy periods. In other cases, they cause no signs or symptoms at all. The growths are typically benign, or noncancerous. The cause of fibroids is unknown.
<br>Fibroids are also known by the following names:
<br>•	leiomyomas
<br>•	myomas
<br>•	uterine myomas
<br>•	fibromas
<br>According to the National Institutes of Health (NIH), about up to 80 percent of women have them by the age of 50. However, most women don’t have any symptoms and may never know they have fibroids.
<br>What are the different types of fibroids?
<br>The type of fibroid a woman develops depends on its location in or on the uterus.
<br>Intramural fibroids
<br>Intramural fibroids are the most common type of fibroid. These types appear within the muscular wall of the uterus. Intramural fibroids may grow larger and can stretch your womb.
<br>Subserosal fibroids
<br>Subserosal fibroids form on the outside of your uterus, which is called the serosa. They may grow large enough to make your womb appear bigger on one side.
<br>Pedunculated fibroids
<br>Subserosal tumors can develop a stem, a slender base that supports the tumor. When they do, they’re known as pedunculated fibroids.
<br>Submucosal fibroids
<br>These types of tumors develop in the middle muscle layer, or myometrium, of your uterus. Submucosal tumors aren’t as common as the other types.

                        <p class="item-text display-7">Menstrual phase
<br>The menstrual phase is the first stage of the menstrual cycle. It’s also when you get your period.
<br>This phase starts when an egg from the previous cycle isn’t fertilized. Because pregnancy hasn’t taken place, levels of the hormones estrogen and progesterone drop.
<br>The thickened lining of your uterus, which would support a pregnancy, is no longer needed, so it sheds through your vagina. During your period, you release a combination of blood, mucus, and tissue from your uterus.
<br>You may have period symptoms like these:
<br>•	cramps (try these home remedies)
<br>•	tender breasts
<br>•	bloating
<br>•	mood swings
<br>•	irritability
<br>•	headaches
<br>•	tiredness
<br>•	low back pain
<br>On average, women are in the menstrual phase of their cycle for 3 to 7 days. Some women have longer periods than others.
<br>Follicular phase
<br>The follicular phase starts on the first day of your period (so there is some overlap with the menstrual phase) and ends when you ovulate.
<br>It starts when the hypothalamus sends a signal to your pituitary gland to release follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH). This hormone stimulates your ovaries to produce around 5 to 20 small sacs called follicles. Each follicle contains an immature egg.
<br>Only the healthiest egg will eventually mature. (On rare occasions, a woman may have two eggs mature.) The rest of the follicles will be reabsorbed into your body.

                        <p class="item-text display-7">Types of C-section incisions
<br>During a C-section, your doctor makes two incisions: The first is through the skin of your lower abdomen, about an inch or two above your pubic hair line. The second is into the uterus, which is where the doctor will reach in to deliver your baby. The type of cut on your abdomen may not be the same as the one on your uterus. Each will be either:
<br>•	Horizontal. A low-transverse incision (or a “bikini cut”) is used in 95 percent of C-sections today. That’s because it’s done across the lowest part of the uterus, which is thinner — resulting in less bleeding. It’s also less likely to split if you try to have a vaginal birth after a C-section (VBAC) when delivering a future baby.
<br>•	Vertical. Also known as a “classical” C-section, this cut is down the middle of the abdomen, usually from below the navel to the pubic hair line. It used to be common, but now is reserved for specific cases, including if you already have a scar there from a previous surgery, if the baby is nestled low in your uterus or in another unusual position, or if an emergency requires immediate delivery (for instance, severe fetal distress or excessive bleeding due to placenta previa). Vertical incisions may be slightly more painful and take a little more time to heal.
<br>How C-section incisions are closed
<br>The incision on the uterus is always closed with dissolvable stitches, but there are three ways doctors close your skin:&nbsp;<br></p>

<br>Secondary navigation
<br>•	Getting pregnant

<br>•	Labour and birth
<br>•	Your newborn
<br>•	Babies and toddlers
<br>Sometimes a doctor or midwife may need to make a cut in the area between the vagina and anus (perineum) during childbirth. This is called an episiotomy.
<br>An episiotomy makes the opening of the vagina a bit wider, allowing the baby to come through it more easily.
<br>Sometimes a woman's perineum may tear as their baby comes out. In some births, an episiotomy can help to prevent a severe tear or speed up delivery if the baby needs to be born quickly.
<br>If your doctor or midwife feels you need an episiotomy when you're in labour, they will discuss this with you. In England, episiotomies are not done routinely.
<br>Non-urgent advice:Call your midwife or GP if you've had an episiotomy or tear and:
<br>•	your stitches get more painful
<br>•	there's smelly discharge
<br>•	there's red, swollen skin around the cut (incision) or tear – you can use a mirror to have a look
<br>Any of these may mean you have an infection.
<br>Up to 9 in 10 first-time mothers who have a vaginal birth will have some sort of tear, graze or episiotomy.
<br>The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) recommends that an episiotomy might be done if:
<br>•	the baby is in distress and needs to be born quickly, or
<br>•	there is a need for forceps or vacuum (ventouse), or

It’s usually not life-threatening, but it’s important to get it treated as soon as possible. It will generally go away when treated by your doctor with antibiotics.
</div><div>Untreated infections can lead to complications with the reproductive organs, issues with fertility, and other general health problems. To minimize your risks, read on to learn what they are, the symptoms, and your outlook if diagnosed.
</div><div>Causes of endometritis
</div><div>Endometritis is generally caused by infection. Infections that can cause endometritis include:
</div><div>•	sexually transmitted infections (STIs), such as chlamydia and gonorrhea
</div><div>•	tuberculosis
</div><div>•	infections resulting from the mixture of normal vaginal bacteria
</div><div>All women have a normal mix of bacteria in their vagina. Endometritis can be caused when this natural mix of bacteria changes after a life event.
</div><div>Risk factors for endometritis
</div><div>You’re at risk of getting an infection that can cause endometritis after a miscarriage or after childbirth, especially following a long labor or a cesarean delivery. You’re also more likely to get endometritis after a medical procedure that involves entering the uterus through the cervix. This can provide a pathway for bacteria to enter. Medical procedures that can increase your risk of developing endometritis include:
</div><div>•	hysteroscopy
</div><div>•	placement of an intrauterine device (IUD)
</div><div>•	dilation and curettage (uterine scraping)
</div><div>Endometritis can occur at the same time as other conditions in the pelvic area, such as an inflammation of the cervix called cervicitis. These conditions may or may not cause symptoms.
</div><div>What are the symptoms of endometritis?
</div><div>Endometritis typically causes the following symptoms:
</div><div>•	abdominal swelling
</div><div>•	abnormal vaginal bleeding
</div><div>•	abnormal vaginal discharge
</div><div>•	constipation
</div><div>•	discomfort when having a bowel movement
</div><div>•	fever
</div><div>•	general feeling of sickness
</div><div>•	pain in the pelvis, lower abdominal area, or rectal area
